As a matter of fact, agriculture is the sector with the highest level of informal employment (93.6%) around the world. Since, jobs in the informal economy offer low wages, farmers need to ensure that their product is of the highest quality so that it gives them maximum wage. Two questions that farmers usually have trouble answering while growing crops are “when do I water?” and “how long do I water for?” Unless farmers know the answers to these questions, they face the risk of damaging their crops by over-watering or they do not water the plants enough and face less crop yield. Both of which do not ensure maximum wage. A very important term used in farming is evapotranspiration. ET is calculated using the solar radiation, relative humidity and recent rainfall. The readings are then used to calculate the soil moisture lost from the soil and then the farmer determines how much water to give to the plant. </i></center><center style="font-size: 50%;">&nbsp;</center>");
